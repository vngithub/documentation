                    On MSNBC's The Ed Show, Ed Shultz reports Rick Berg - the 14th richest member of Congress - and his campaign staff did not know what the current minimum wage is in North Dakota, when asked at a campaign event. Berg has voted at least three times against raising the minimum wage but voted eleven times to raise his own pay.

                    Senatorial hopeful, corporate prostitute, and presumably full-grown man Rick Berg still lets his mommy keep him underfoot. The current North Dakota Representative and professional Kevin Spacey impersonator made the mistake of shooting this off-the-cuff human interest-themed primary campaign TV spot with his farm-dyke mother. Things, though, go horribly awry as Francie continues to go off script. Hopefully, the TMI factor resulting from this ad won't affect Little Ricky's showings on election day. DISCLAIMER: I mean no ill intent towards Sue Johanson in this video, nor do I own Sue or Little Ricky.

                    Addressing Bismarck Republicans, Rick Berg said that he's "pumped" about Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as the Republican Vice-Presidential nominee and explained that Paul Ryan had told Berg that it's worth losing reelection for taking controversial stances on issues -- like voting to end Medicare.

                    KXJB's Valley News Live reports that Rick Berg - the 14th richest member of Congress - was asked by a voter what the minimum wage is in North Dakota and he did not know the answer. Berg has repeatedly voted against raising the minimum wage but voted eleven times to raise his own pay.

Here is the DONATE link: www.paypal.com This version finally cuts several bogus quotes which have festered in the monetary reform literature for decades.

Remember: It's not what backs the money, it's who controls its quantity.

    History     




   
Prior to European contact, Native Americans inhabited North Dakota for thousands of years. The first European to reach the area was the                                                                 French-Canadian     trader                                                            La VÃ©rendrye    , who led an exploration party to                                               Mandan     villages in 1738. The trading arrangement between tribes was such that North Dakota tribes rarely dealt directly with Europeans. However, the native tribes were in sufficient contact that by the time that                                                                                       Lewis and Clark     entered North Dakota in 1804, they were aware of the French and then Spanish claims to their territory.
    

   

Much of present-day North Dakota was included in the                                                                       Louisiana Purchase     of 1803; the remainder was acquired in the                                                               Treaty of 1818    .  The acquired land was organized into                                                                         Minnesota     and                                                                       Nebraska     Territories.                                                                   Dakota Territory    , making up present-day North and                                                           South Dakota    , along with parts of present-day                                                 Wyoming     and                                                 Montana    , was                                                                         organized     on MarchÂ 2, 1861.
    

   
Dakota Territory was settled sparsely until the late 19th century, when the railroads entered the region and aggressively marketed the land. An omnibus bill for statehood for North Dakota,                                                           South Dakota    ,                                                 Montana    , and                                                                               Washington     titled the                                                                           Enabling Act of 1889     was passed on February 22, 1889 during the administration of                                                                   Grover Cleveland    . After Cleveland left office, it was left to his successor,                                                                     Benjamin Harrison    , to sign proclamations formally admitting North and South Dakota to the Union on NovemberÂ 2, 1889.
    

   
The rivalry between the two new states presented a dilemma of which was to be admitted first. Harrison directed Secretary of State                                                                James G. Blaine     to shuffle the papers and obscure from him which he was signing first and the actual order went unrecorded, thus no one knows which of the Dakotas was admitted first. However, since     North Dakota      alphabetically appears before     South Dakota     , its proclamation was published first in the Statutes At Large. Since that day, it has become common to list the Dakotas alphabetically and thus North Dakota is usually listed as the 39thÂ state.
    

   
Unrest among wheat farmers, especially among Norwegians, led to a radical political movement after World War I centered in the left-wing                                                                         Non Partisan League     ("NPL"). The NPL, which eventually merged into the                                                                                                                                Democratic Party    , attempted to insulate North Dakota from the power of out-of-state banks and corporations. In addition to founding the state-owned                                                                           Bank of North Dakota     and                                                                                               North Dakota Mill and Elevator     (both still in existence), the NPL established a state-owned railroad line (later sold to the                                                                     Soo Line Railroad    ). Anti-corporate laws were passed that virtually prohibited a corporation or bank from owning title to land zoned as farmland. These laws, still in force today, after having been upheld by both state and federal courts, make it almost impossible to foreclose on farmland, as even after foreclosure, the property title cannot be held by a bank or mortgage company.
    

   
A round of federal construction projects began in the 1950s, including the                                                           Garrison Dam     and the                                                                           Minot     and                                                                                       Grand Forks                                                                                     Air Force     bases. There was a boom in oil exploration in western North Dakota in the 1980s, as rising petroleum prices made development profitable.

From fewer than 2,000 people in 1870, North Dakota's population grew to near 680,000 by 1930. Growth then slowed, and the population has fluctuated slightly over the past seven decades, hitting a low of 617,761 in the 1970 census, with a total of 642,200 in the 2000 census. The                                                                                         United States Census Bureau    , as of JulyÂ 1, 2008, estimated North Dakota's population at 641,481, which represents a decrease of 714, or 0.1%, since the last census in 2000. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 20,460 people (that is 67,788 births minus 47,328 deaths) and a decrease due to net migration of 17,787 people out of the state.

    Emigration     
Throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century, North Dakota, along with most of the midwest, experienced a mass influx of newcomers both from the eastern United States and new arrivals from Europe. North Dakota was a known popular destination for immigrant farmers and general laborers and their families, mostly from Great Britain, Norway, Sweden and Germany. Much of this settlement gravitated throughout the western side of the Red River Valley, as was similarly seen in South Dakota and in a parallel manner in Minnesota. This area is well known for its fertile lands, and by the outbreak of the First World War was among the richest farming regions in North America.


   
From 1923 through the beginning of the 21st century, North Dakota experienced a virtually constant decline in population, particularly among younger people with university degrees. With the advancing process of mechanization of agricultural practices, subsistence farming proved to be too risky for families, and many people moved to urban areas for jobs. One of the major causes of emigration in North Dakota is the lack of skilled jobs for college graduates.  Some propose the expansion of economic development programs to create skilled and high-tech jobs, but the effectiveness of such programs has been open to debate. During the first decade of the 21st century, the population increased, in large part because of jobs in the oil industry, related to development of oil-shale fields.

    Ethnic groups and ancestry     
Most North Dakotans are of Northern European descent. As of 2009, the five largest ancestry groups in North Dakota are:

    Religion     
North Dakota has the most churches per capita of any state.


   
A 2001 survey indicated that 35% of North Dakota's population was                                                         Lutheran    , and 30% was                                                                                                               Roman Catholic    . Other religious groups represented were                                                       Methodists    Â (7%),                                                   Baptists    Â (6%), the                                                                     Assemblies of God    Â (3%), and                                                                     Jehovah's Witness    Â (1%). Christians with unstated or other denominational affiliations, including other                                                                         Protestants     and                                                                                                                                 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints     (                                                    Mormonism    ), totaled 3%, bringing the total Christian population to 86%. Other religions, such as Judaism, Islam,                                                   Buddhism    , and                                                   Hinduism    , together represented 4% of the population. There were an estimated 920Â Muslims and 730Â Jews in the state in 2000.  Three percent of respondents answered "no religion" on the survey, and 6% declined to answer.
    

   
The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2000 were the Roman Catholic Church with 179,349; the                                                                                                               Evangelical Lutheran Church in America     with 174,554; and the                                                                                                 Lutheran ChurchâMissouri Synod     with 23,720.
    

   
    
    Culture     
    American Indian presence     
North Dakota has a great number of Native Americans. Powwows (or pow-wows) are an important aspect of Native American culture. Throughout Native American history, powwows were held, usually in the spring, to rejoice on the beginning of new life. These events brought Native American tribes together for singing and dancing and allowed them to meet up with old friendships, as well as to make new ones. Many powwows also held religious significance for some tribes. Today, powwows are still a part of the Native American culture, and are attended by Native and non-Natives alike. In North Dakota, the United Tribes International Powwow, held each September in                                                                              Bismarck    , is one of the largest powwows in the United States.


   
A powwow is complete with parades and dancers in regalia, with many dancing styles presented. It is traditional for male dancers to wear regalia decorated with beads, quills and eagle feathers; male grass dancers wear colorful fringe regalia; and male fancy dancers wear brightly colored feathers. Female dancers dance much more subtly than the male dancers. Fancy female dancers wear cloth, beaded moccasins and jewelry, while the jingle dress dancer wears a dress made of metal cones. There are intertribal dances throughout the powwow, where everyone (even spectators) can take part in the dancing.
    

   
    
    Norwegian and Icelandic influence     
Around 1870 many European immigrants from Norway settled in North Dakota's northeastern corner, especially near the Red River. Icelanders also arrived from Canada.                                                                            Pembina     housed many Norwegians when it was founded; they worked on family farms. They started Lutheran  churches and schools and they greatly outnumbered other denominations in the area. This group has unique foods such as                                             lefse     and                                                   lutefisk    . The continent's largest Scandinavian event,                                                                    Norsk HÃ¸stfest         , is celebrated each September in                                                                        Minot    .

    Germans from Russia     

Ethnic Germans who had settled in Russia for several generations grew dissatisfied in the nineteenth century. About 100,000 immigrated to the U.S. by 1900, settling primarily in North and South Dakota, Kansas and Nebraska. The south-central part of North Dakota became known as "the German-Russian triangle". By 1910, about 60,000 ethnic Germans from Russia lived in Central North Dakota. They were Lutherans and Roman Catholics who had kept many German customs of the time when their ancestors emigrated to Russia.  They were committed to agriculture. A famous art form by such ethnic Germans are                                                                           wrought iron crosses    , which are used to mark grave sites.

The oil reserves of the                                                                   Bakken Formation     may hold up to  of oil, 25Â times larger than the reserves in the                                                                                                 Arctic National Wildlife Refuge    .  However, a report issued in April 2008 by the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that the oil recoverable by current technology in the Bakken formation is two orders of magnitude less, in the range of  to , with a mean of .

    Tourism     
North Dakota is considered the least visited state, owing, in part, to its not having a major tourist attraction. Areas popular with visitors include                                                                                                   Theodore Roosevelt National Park     in the western part of the state. The park often exceeds 475,000 visitors each year. Regular events in the state that attract tourists include                                                                    Norsk HÃ¸stfest          in                                                                        Minot    , billed as North America's largest                                                         Scandinavia    n festival; the                                                               Medora Musical    ; and the                                                                                 North Dakota State Fair    .


   
    
    Medicine     
North Dakota is the only US state that legally demands its pharmacies to have 51% shares owned by pharmacists. This is the reason typical locations, such as Wal-Mart, Target, Walgreens, and other national chains are unable to fill prescriptions in their stores.


   
    
    Transportation     


Transportation in North Dakota is overseen by the                                                                                                                     North Dakota Department of Transportation    .

A unique feature of the North Dakota Interstate Highway system, is that virtually all of it is paved in concrete, rather than blacktop, because of the extreme weather conditions it must endure.  The largest rail systems in the state are operated by                                           BNSF     and the                                                                                   Canadian Pacific Railway    . Many branch lines formerly used by BNSF and Canadian Pacific Railway are now operated by the                                                                                                                          Dakota, Missouri Valley and Western Railroad     and the                                                                                                             Red River Valley and Western Railroad    .

    Politics     


The major political parties in North Dakota are the                                                                                                     Democratic-NPL     and the                                                                                             Republican Party    . , the                                                                                                      Constitution Party     and the                                                                                                    Libertarian Party     are also organized parties in the state.


   
At the state level, the                                                                                   governorship     has been held by the Republican Party since 1992, along with a majority of the state legislature and statewide officers. Dem-NPL showings were strong in the 2000 governor's race, and in the 2006 legislative elections, but the League has not had a major breakthrough since the administration of former state governor                                                             George Sinner    .
    

   
The Republican Party presidential candidate usually carries the state; in 2004,                                                              George W. Bush     won with 62.9% of the vote. Of all the Democratic presidential candidates since 1892, only                                                                   Grover Cleveland    ,                                                               Woodrow Wilson    ,                                                                       Franklin Roosevelt    , and                                                               Lyndon Johnson     received                                                                                                    Electoral College     votes from North Dakota.
    

   
On the other hand, Dem-NPL candidates for North Dakota's federal Senate and House seats have won every election between 1982 and 2008, and the state's federal delegation was entirely Democratic from 1987 to 2011.

"The Flickertail State" is one of North Dakota's nicknames and is derived from                                                                                           Richardson's Ground Squirrel     (    Spermophilus richardsonii     ), a very common animal in the region. The ground squirrel constantly flicks its tail in a distinctive manner. In 1953, legislation to make the ground squirrel the state emblem was voted down in the state legislature.

Berg has voted at least three times against raising the minimum wage but voted eleven times to raise his own pay.

The current North Dakota Representative and professional Kevin Spacey impersonator made the mistake of shooting this off-the-cuff human interest-themed primary campaign TV spot with his farm-dyke mother. Things, though, go horribly awry as Francie continues to go off script. Hopefully, the TMI factor resulting from this ad won't affect Little Ricky's showings on election day.

Here is the DONATE link: www.paypal.com This version finally cuts several bogus quotes which have festered in the monetary reform literature for decades.

Remember: It's not what backs the money, it's who controls its quantity.

                       	The World News (WN) Network, has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to user privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for wn.com, as well as e-mail newsletters.    


    1. Personal Information Collection and Use     

   We do not collect personally identifiable information about you, except when you provide it to us. For example, if you submit an inquiry to us or sign up for our newsletter, you may be asked to provide certain information such as your contact details (name, e-mail address, mailing address, etc.).    

   When you submit your personally identifiable information through wn.com, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
    
   Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will use the information you provide us only for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or in connection with the service for which you provided such information. We may forward your contact information and inquiry to our affiliates and other divisions of our company that we feel can best address your inquiry or provide you with the requested service. We may also use the information you provide in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans. We may share or transfer such non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees, agents and partners.    

   We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Such third parties may be provided with access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose.    

   In addition, we may disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal proceeding or governmental request.    

    2. E-mail addresses     

   We do not want you to receive unwanted e-mail from us. We try to make it easy to opt-out of any service you have asked to receive. If you sign-up to our e-mail newsletters we do not sell, exchange or give your e-mail address to a third party.    

   E-mail addresses are collected via the wn.com web site. Users have to physically opt-in to receive the wn.com newsletter and a verification e-mail is sent. wn.com is clearly and conspicuously named at the point of     collection.

   If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by e-mailing us at michaelw(at)wn.com    

   The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during registration and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100 percent secure, however. Therefore, though we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.    
   
If we decide to change our e-mail practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we think appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.    

   If we make material changes to our e-mail practices, we will notify you here, by e-mail, and by means of a notice on our home page.    

 

    3. Third Party Advertisers     

   The advertising banners and other forms of advertising appearing on this Web site are sometimes delivered to you, on our behalf, by a third party. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, the third party may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. For more information on cookies, you can visit www.cookiecentral.com.    

    4. Business Transfers     

   As we continue to develop our business, we might sell certain aspects of our entities or assets. In such transactions, user information, including personally identifiable information, generally is one of the transferred business assets, and by submitting your personal information on Wn.com you agree that your data may be transferred to such parties in these circumstances.
